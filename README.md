# CSP-Rules-Examples<br><br>

## Examples for the CSP-Rules-V2.1 software</b><br><br>



<br><br>
## 1. What is CSP-Rules-V2.1?<br>
A _finite binary Constraint Satisfaction Problems_ (CSP) is defined by a finite set of variables (hereafter called the CSP-Variables), each with a finite domain; the problem is to find a value for each variable in its domain, in such a way that these values satisfy a set of pre-defined binary constraints. A typical popular example is Sudoku.<br>
**_CSP-Rules is a general pattern-based (or rule-based) solver of finite binary CSPs_**. <br>
It includes a Latin Squares solver, a Sudoku solver, a Futoshiki solver, a Kakuro solver, a solver of Map Colouring Problems, a Hidato solver, a Numbrix solver and a Slitherlink solver. <br>
CSP-Rules-V2.1 is independently available on GitHub: https://github.com/denis-berthier/CSP-Rules-V2.1 and is necessary if you want to run by yourself the examples given in the present repository.<br>


<br><br>
## 2. What is there in this CSP-Rules-Examples repository?<br>
The present CSP-Rules-Examples repository is an outgrowth of the CSP-Rules-V2.1 repository, of which it was originally a part.<br>
The main reasons for turning it into an independent repository are:<br>
- it allows adding examples without making a new release of CSP-Rules itself,
- it allows to have this detailed README file without overloading the CSP-Rules-V2.1 README file with details that are not globally relevant to CSP-Rules.<br><br>

Sections 4 to 10 describe the contents of each application folder.


<br><br>
## 3. Installation<br>
Download CSP-Rules-Examples from the master branch (by clicking the "Code" button and then the "Download zip" option), unzip the resulting file, rename it to "CSP-Rules-Examples" (in particular, delete the possible "-master" part in its name.<br>
If you just want to have a look at the exaples, that's all you need to do. If you want to run the examples for yourself with the CSP-Rules-V2.1 software, move the "CSP-Rules-Examples" folder into the "CSP-Rules" folder you have created when installing CSP-Rules-V2.1. (Notice: into the "CSP-Rules" folder, not into the CSP-Rules-V2.1 folder!) That way, you should be able to directly copy and paste the commands present in the example files.
