# CONTRIBUTING TO CSP-RULES-EXAMPLES

Any contribution to CSP-Rules-Examples is welcome.<br>
There are several ways you can contribute to it, either at the general level or at the level of some of its applications.<br>
The following are non restrictive suggestions, any other idea is welcome, but **the general rules of good conduct will be applied strictly: no PR that doesn't respect them will be taken into consideration**.<br>
As a general background for these rules, you should always keep in mind that **the CSP-Rules user is not supposed to be a programmer, let alone an expert one**.<br><br>

## General rules of "good conduct" 

* For any change you want to propose, make a fork and a Pull Request.<br><br>


## Contributing to the Examples 
Adding more examples is not a goal _per se_. However, if you find an example with some interesting characteristics not shown in the other examples, or an example that provides a better illustration of the existing rules, you can propose it for inclusion or as a replacement for an existing one.<br>
Do not forget to describe the full configuration choices made in your example.<br>
If your example involves solving a collection of puzzles in a .txt file or .csv file or in any other format, don't forget to write the full command you used to do this, always referring to files via the ?*CSP-Rules-Exampes* global variable of CSP-Rules-V2.1.<br>
If your example requires some additional code to read or deal with the ewample, don't forget to include it.
